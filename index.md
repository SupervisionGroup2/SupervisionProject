<h1>Project Connect 4</h1>
<h2>By Group 2: Mohamed Abdelsalam, William Cook and Bento Rodrigues</h2>
<p>This web page will be used to present our project at its stages and when it is complete.</p>
<h3>What our project is</h3>
<p>Our project will be a recreation of Connect 4: “Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces
  on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. ... Both players begin with 21 identical 
  pieces, and the first player to achieve a line of four connected pieces wins the game.”

<h4>The code</h3>

<h5>The design</h5>
<p>We are aiming to recreate the classic look of the game. This is a blue game board, with yellow and red pieces. We will be using java swing for the graphics.</p>
