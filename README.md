The repository for the group 2 software project - Connect Four

Our project is Connect-Four, a tic-tac-toe like game where two players take alternate turns placing a piece in a vertical board with 7 columns and 6 rows. Both players start with 21 identical pieces, where each player's pieces are a different colour, e.g. player 1 has blue pieces and player 2 has red pieces. The winner is the first player to get four connected pieces in a line, which can be diagonal, vertical or horizontal. Within a menu the main player can select to play against another player or play against an AI.
